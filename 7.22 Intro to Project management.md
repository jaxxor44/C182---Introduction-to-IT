- Initiation Phase
- Planning Phase
- Execution Phase
- Project Closure

### Project Initiation
This phase broadly defines the project, usually initiated with a business case, followed by a feasibility study. Project stakeholders provide input in the analysis of the business case.
Produces a project charter or project initiation document that outlines things like business needs, the stakeholders and the business case. In other words, define the problem then do a study to see if it is worth solving. ^491c8b

### Project Planning
Initiates a roadmap that everyone follows. Begin setting project goals, commonly using the SMART or CLEAR frameworks:

| ----SMART----    |                                 [Framework description](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/others/smart-goal/)                                 |
|:----------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  Specific  | Set a specific goal that answers the questions who, what, where, when, which and why. |
| Measurable |         Create criteria that can be used to measure the success of the goal.          |
| Attainable |                   Ensure the goal is attainable given the resources                   |
| Realistic  |                    Assess the willingness to work toward the goal.                    |
|   Timely   |             The goal should be achievable within the available timeframe.             |


| -----------CLEAR-----------         | [Framework description](https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/forget-smart-goals-try-clear-goals-instead.html)                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Collaborative | The goal should encourage employees to work together                                                                                                |
| Limited       | The goal should be limited in scope and time to keep it manageable.                                                                                 |
| Emotional     | The goal should tap into the passion of employees and be something they can form an emotional connection to. This can optimize the quality of work. |
| Appreciable   | Break larger goals into smaller tasks into smaller tasks that can be quickly achieved.                                                              |
| Re-finable     | As new situations arise, be flexible and refine the goal as needed.                                                                                 |


By the end of the planning phase, a project usually has the following:
- scope statement outlining the objectives, deliverables and milestones
- Work breakdown structure (WBS) breaking the project into manageable segments for the team
- milestones defining high-level goals to meet throughout the project's duration.
- Communication plan outlining the frequency and methods of communicating with stakeholders
- risk management plan identifying foreseeable risk, including cost overruns and delays.

### Project Execution
During project execution, project deliverables are developed and completed. A kickoff meeting usually marks the start of this phase. Tasks include:
- developing the project team
- assigning resources
- setting up tracking systems
- conducting status meetings
- monitoring the project timeline.

Project performance is constantly observed during this phase and compared to key metrics.

### Project Closure
At this phase, the project is declared complete, and the team is dissolved. Managers complete final documentation, including final reports. This phase also includes meetings for members to reflect on strengths and opportunities for improvement.
Questions include:
- was the problem solved
- how was the team's performance
- did we communicate with stakeholders?

## Risks
### Risks in execution
These are the more common things that are considered risk:
- cost overrun
- insufficient staff
- inadequate tools to support the project
- lack of support from project stakeholders

The best way to combat these risks is planning in advance.

### Risks of integration
This is the risk of the project disrupting other systems or processes within the organization. To identify integration problems, frequently monitor project parameters/milestones and communication between project participants.

### Common project risks
#### scope creep
The uncontrolled change of a project's scope, typically adding tasks and increased, unplanned costs to the project.

#### Budget risk
budget control issues, such as underestimated or improper allocation of cost.

#### Resistance to change
departments and individuals resist organizational changes resulting from the project

#### Resource risk
inability to secure sufficient resources for the project

#### Contract risk
a vendor fails to deliver on contractual obligations

#### Disputes
Conflict between project participants

#### Project dependencies
especially when the completion of a task requires the completion of others first.

#### Project assumptions risk
when assumptions about the project are invalidated during development.

#### Benefit shortfall
the project meets the requirements but delivers fewer benefits than outlined in the business case.

#### Requirements quality of risk
requirements have not been properly validated or documented

#### Force majure risk
a major negative event beyond human control.
