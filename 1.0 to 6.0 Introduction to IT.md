# Data
## Database Management and Administration
### Database Management Systems (DBMS)
A typical database application has two major layers:
1. application layer.
2. Database management layer.

The application layer communicates with the end user and can be fairly complex. The application layer takes the desired action from the user and passes it to the database management system as a tool to obtain the results. Examples of a DBMS are Microsoft Access or OpenOffice Base.

### Database interaction lifecycle:
1. Data is pushed into the database by raw information producers
2. The database is queried by the end user to generate useful reports.
3. The database has data pulled into reports.

### Possible error?

### Wisdom
**Wisdom** is knowing the right thing to do. Applied knowledge , looking forward, is wisdom.
### Knowledge
**Knowledge** is a dynamic combination of experience, values, contextual information, expert insight and grounded intuition that provides an environment and framework for evaluating and incorporating new experiences and information. Knowledge is applying context to Information. ^86e755
### Information
**Information** can be structured or unstructured, and the key term is meaning. Information is the application of meaning to data, providing the needed filter to understand what the raw data is saying.
### Data
**Data** is raw facts or observations. Mostly inert in its current state, and requires more time and energy to create value.
