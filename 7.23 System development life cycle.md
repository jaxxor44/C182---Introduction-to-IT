# 7.23 System development life cycle

## Objectives
- Define project initiation, risk and business impact analysis, risk mitigation and control.
- Describe the characteristics of a project and identify its phases.

## System Development

### Case
Improvements in software to capture the Software Development Life cycle (SDLC) lead to the development of Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) domain of software development, and includes things like:
- Project planning, scheduling and personnel allocation
- documentation tools to assist with writing, organizing, and managing documents.
- Interface design tools to develop graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
- programming tools to assist in writing and debugging code.

### SDLC
has 6 phases:
1. Planning
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

### Requirements Analysis
The goal is to determine what services the system will provide, any conditions like security and time constraints, and how the user will interact with the system.
The input from users and stakeholders is critical during this phase, as are other legal or financial conditionals. A feasibility study is a part of this process that determines if the given constraints and company mission are in alignment with this development.

Generally, the requirement's analysis process consists of three steps:
1. Compiling and analyzing the needs of the system
2. Negotiating with project stakeholders on trade-offs between wants, needs, costs, and feasibility.
3. Developing a set of requirements for identifying the necessary features and services of the completed system.

### Design

The System Requirement Specification (SRS) is a written agreement between all parties that records the system requirements, and guides development. Organizations like the IEEE and the DoD have standards in place for requirement specifications.

| Design                                       | requirement analysis                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| creates a plan for constructing the system.  | describes the system                 |
| plans a soloution                            | identifies the problem to be solved. |
| deciding how the system should do somehting. | decides what the system should do.   |

### Implementation and integration
The system is actually built during this phase. Increased technical skill is needed here to complete the programming and development. From here, a system analyst will be involved throughout the entire development process, whereas a programmer writes programs that implement the design produced by the system analyst.

### System Maintenance
In this phase, the system is monitored, evaluated and modified as needed in a continuous cycle.

#### Corrective maintenance
removes errors and ensure functionality of the system.
#### Adaptive maintenance
preformed when an organizational change affect system requirements, e.g. organizational procedures, forms or system control and security needs.
#### Perfective maintenance
preformed when new components are introduced or existing components are improved, to enhance overall system performance.
#### Preventive maintenance
changes made to increase the lifespan of a system and could include restructuring, optimizing code or updating documentation that impacts the scalability, stability, and maintainability of the system.

## Quality assurance
the ISO 9000 series of standards address industrial activities such as design, production, installation, and servicing. The ISO/IEC 15504 is a set of standards common for third-party system developers to meet.

A more common 3 step development process is :
1. Requirements analysis and confirmation
2. Design and validation
3. Implementation and testing

>[!info]
>**The Pareto principle**
>The theory that 80% of errors come from 20% of the system.

>[!info]
>**Basis Path Testing**
>Develop a set of test data that ensures each instruction in the software is executed at least once.

The Pareto and basis path testing methodologies all require internal system knowledge, and are commonly referred to as white-box testing (or glass-box testing).
Black-box testing more often focuses on the user experience (UX). 
### Black-box testing
#### Alpha
internal testing of the UX by developers or test team.
#### Beta
The system is given to a select group of users for testing. Also known as pilot testing.
#### User acceptance
Users test the system in an operational setting to make sure the system continues to align with business objectives and meet goals of stakeholders.


### Documentation
3 types of documentation
1. user documentation
	- explained the system to users, includes FAQs, and contact info for customer support.
2. System documentation
	- describes the system's internal configuration, so the system can be maintained later in its life cycle. A major part of software development is writing documentation.
3. Technical documentation
	- describes how to install and maintain the system, including information about installing updates and providing feedback.

## System Engineering Methodologies
### Agile Methodologies
Uses incremental implementations, respond rapidly to changes in requirements and reduce emphasis on rigorous requirements. SCRUM and extreme programming are both examples of agile methodologies. 
#### Scrum
a hands-on system consisting of simple steps:
1. The system owner makes a prioritized wish list
2. Scrum team selects an item toward the top of the wish list and plans the implementation during an event called 'sprint'.
3. The team completes the list of objectives while assessing progress in daily meetings called scrums.
4. The sprint ends with the system ready to be released.
5. A new sprint starts using another item on the wish list.
6. This process continues until the prioritized wish list is clear.

## Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
>[!quote]
>If an organization is required to have 99.999% uptime, it is stated as "five nines."

Five nines is less than 3 seconds of downtime per week. Various contracts may stipulate five nines and require a Disaster recover plan (DRP) to ensure systems can recover from catastrophic events in a reasonable amount of time, with minimal loss. 

In the event of a system outage, a business continuity plan helps ensure vital business operations remain operational, even if auxiliary systems remain offline. This plan also covers how the business will continue to make money on this limited functionality.
