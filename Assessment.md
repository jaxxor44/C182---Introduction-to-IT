#### 15

>[!question]
>Which of the following programming languages first introduced the concept of object-oriented programming?
>>[!answer]-
>Smalltalk

Smalltalk is no longer covered content in this course.
I recommend a question that asks something like "What of these listed is an object-oriendted programming language?" to keep the theme of the question the same.

#### 16

>[!question]
>Which of the four main components of a computer is described by this statement: This component facilitates the flow of information/ communication between components and peripheral devices.
>>[!answer]-
>I/O subsystem

This question seems outdated, or at least confusing to read. Asking for a component sounds like a single physical component, not a whole subsystem. This is especially confusing when the term 'Bus' is also an option. It's also not in the current literature, what "The four main components of a computer" actually are. Could this question be removed or changed to reflect the [[2.6 Computer systems#^d003d9|IPOS]] system instead?

#### 17

>[!question]
>Which project phase defines the problem or opportunity that the project is expected to address?
>>[!answer]-
>initiation

![[7.22 Intro to Project management#^491c8b]]


#### 18

>[!question]
>During implementation, which testing method is preformed by the end user (in a limited fashion) using actual data in the real working enviornment?
>>[!answer]-
>Beta

Alpha testing:
preformed internally to identify bugs and faults in the software.

Beta testing (pilot testing):
Testing done by a select group of end users to test from their perspective.

User acceptance Testing:
Users test the system in an operational setting to make sure the system continues to align with business objectives.


#### 19

>[!question]
>What is the focus of the list of responsabilities for database admins?
>>[!answer]-
>design, development, and DBMS support

>[!quote] WGU
>The database administrator is responsible for installing and configuring databases. This position also fixes database errors and creates user accounts. This position requires a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science or computer engineering. The MySQL and Oracle Database certifications are examples of certifications that demonstrate up-to-date knowledge and skills.

#### 20

>[!question]
>Whick of the following is a scripting interface between a database and the application?
>>[!answer]-
>SQL

Should this question reflect that SQL is a database query language, not a scripting language?
Could this question be better worded as:

>"What *language* is used to communicate between an application and a database?"

This would illustrate the difference between DBMS and SQL in the choices.

#### 21

>[!question]
>Cassandra is developing a method to register conference attendees by extracting the attendee's information and saving it to a database. The information is obtained from the conference website and once they click submit, the information is saved to the database and a new confirmation webpage is generated showing the attendees specific information.
>>[!answer]-
>Scripting language.

It's unclear what this question is asking. If the question is "what is the type of language Cassandra is using?" then HISTORICLY, this could be true. However, Currently, Frameworks like Flask and Django allow the Python Programming language to complete all of these tasks and more.
