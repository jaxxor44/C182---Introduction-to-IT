# 8.25 Introduction to Ethics

# Ethics, Law, and Regulation of information Technology

Define computer security ethics and privacy. #goals 

## Legal, Ethical, and Regulatory Issues in the Computing Disciplines

Data has 3 primary states:
1. In use
2. In transit
3. at rest

>[!question] #question 
>What is the current law regarding data that is in use/in transit/at rest?

## Ethics and information Technology
There are several types of ethics:
- consequence based
- duty-based
- contract-based
- character-based

Most commonly, character-based ethics is what is explored or understood.

>[!question] #question
>When a business creates a new product, at what point does regulation come into play? Ethically, should regulation already exist?

## Why Ethics in IT is Important
IT professionals have large access to sensitive data. You must consider personal access to the CIA triad and evaluate data classes to restriction levels that are appropriate or legal.

## Codes of Professional Conduct and Professional Organizations
### The 10 commandments of computer Ethics
1. Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people.
2. Thou shalt not interfere with other people's computer work.
3. Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files.
4. Thou shalt not use a computer to steal
5. Thou shalt not use a computer to bear false witness.
6. Thou shalt not copy or use proprietary software for which you have not paid (without permission)
7. Thou shalt not use other people's computer resources without authorization or proper compensation.
8. Thou shalt not appropriate other people's intellectual output.
9. Thou shalt think about the social consequences of the program you are writing or the system you are designing.
10. Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that ensure consideration and respect for other humans.
[The ten commandments of computer ethics](http://cpsr.org/issues/ethics/cei/)

### Asimov's Three laws of robotics
1. A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey orders given it by a human being, except where such orders would conflict with the first law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.
[Asimov's three laws of robotics](https://epsrc.ukri.org/)

While the above laws originated in science fiction, they inspired the Engineering and physical sciences research council (EPSRC) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) to create 5 ethical "principles for designers, builders and users of robots".
1. Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans.
2. Humans, not robots, are responsible agents. Robots are tools designed to achieve human goals.
3. Robots should be designed in ways that assure their safety and security.
4. Robots are artifacts; they should not be designed to exploit vulnerable users by evoking an emotional response of dependency. It should always be possible to tell a robot from a human.
5. It should always be possible to find out who is legally responsible for a robot.

## Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
Ethical standards have been published by multiple professional organizations such as:
- [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)](https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code/)
- [The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html)
- [The American Statistical Association (ASA)](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx)
- [The Association of Information Technology Professionals (AITP)](https://sites.google.com/a/gmatc.matc.edu/aitp/code-of-ethics)

## The Ethical Culture of an Organization
When personal ethics and organizational ethics conflict, it's expected to abide by the organization's code of ethics. 
#### Acceptable Use Policy
A set of policies for Computer users is outlined in an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), and includes points like:
- Legal considerations, including data security laws, jurisdiction, the ownership of systems and data, and the proper use of intellectual property.
- Data security provisions, including personal responsibilities of users, ways the systems can and cannot be used, and types of unacceptable web content.
- Liability considerations, outlining disclaimers that remove an organization's responsibilities for data breaches, information theft, or misuse of the internet.

>[!question] #question 
>If an organization's AUP denies access to a particular resource, does that company have an obligation to block it from users? Or at least give the best effort to restrict access to disallowed resources?

## Privacy
Privacy is defined in terms of IT by how your data is used and the governance of personal data, including how it's collected, shared and used.
Security is how your data is protected from illegal activity or data breach.

The International Association of Privacy Professionals (AIPP), helps organizations design and apply appropriate approaches to privacy.
